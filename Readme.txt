🐍 My Snake Game
🎮 Overview

This project is a classic Snake Game built in Python using the Turtle Graphics library.
The player controls the snake using the arrow keys and tries to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen.
Each time the snake eats, the score increases (you can add this later), and the game continues until the snake collides with the wall or itself.

⚙️ Features

✅ Smooth snake movement using keyboard input (↑ ↓ ← →)

✅ Random food placement on every eat

✅ Realistic collision detection between snake and food

✅ Expandable design (easy to add score, levels, or game-over logic)
